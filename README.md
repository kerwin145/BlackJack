# BlackJack

Heelo! This is my first commmit, and it is a functional version of blackjack I coded in java. 
It includes the standard hit and stay. You can also place bets, split, place insurance, and double down.

The graphics is meh... this is my first time working with loading pictures. 

The code is fully functional. Currently, however, there is a bug with double down when splitting, which causes you to automatically finish the split round when you hit it....
if anyone would have the patience to read it over (yes, all the code is in one class, and that file is 1000+ lines long, probably will be difficult to navigate) and 
find a way to fix it (probably a logic error) it would be very very very much appreciated... 

Nevertheless, thanks a lot for taking a look at this project, it means a lot to me. :)
