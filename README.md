# BlackJack

Hello! This is my first commmit, and it is a functional version of blackjack I coded in java. 
It includes the standard hit and stay. You can also place bets, split, place insurance, and double down.

This almost resembles the real version of blackjack, where your bet is subtracted from your total once the round starts, and you earn double the bet if you win the round.  
Tutorial slides are available in the game. 

The graphics are meh... this is my first time working with loading pictures. The text for player card, computer card, and round outocmes are a bit packed. Nevertheless, they are still readable. 

The code is functional (there are no runtime errors). Currently, however, there are two bugs. One is with doubling down during a split, which  ends the split round once clicked (the results of the first round still go through). Another bug is with insurance, which does not account for the player not being able to afford it. 
These bugs will be fixed sometime in the future...

Thanks for the read, and feel free to download.
